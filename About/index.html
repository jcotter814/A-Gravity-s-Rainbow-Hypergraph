        <p>"We have to look for power sources here, and distribution networks we were never taught, routes of power our teachers
        never imagined, or were encouraged to avoid ... we have to find meters whose scales are unknown in the world, draw 
        our own schematics, getting feedback, making connections, reducing the error, trying to learn the real function ... 
        zeroing in on what incalculable plot?" (521). </p>

        <p>Gravity's Rainbow is a novel in many respects about human attempts to impose order on and construct meaning 
        from the torrent of sensory data that floods our senses at every moment. Pavlovianism, statistics, rocketry, organic chemistry, 
        Kabbalah, Rosicrucianism, Protestantism, Tarot, Astrology, military industrial conspiracies, S&M and more are all depicted as 
        methods of systematizing and constructing meaning out of a stream of information that may in reality be nothing more 
        than noise. Pynchon digs into the technical details of these methods, exposing their common structure and
        shared origin as an expression of a human longing for meaning. Or, as put more eloquently by <a href = https://gravitys-rainbow.pynchonwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Rocket_Power>Richard Poirier</a> 
        "It is not enough to say that Pynchon records the effects of technology on human lives or adapts the methods of technology to the
        investigation and dramatization of them ... He is locating the  kinds of human consciousness that have been 
        implanted <i>in</i> the instruments of technology and contemporary methods of analysis; not content with 
        recording the historical effect of these, he is anxious  to find our history <i>in</i> them." The plot of the book 
        mirrors this form, bombarding the reader with an endless succession of characters, plots, agencies, connections and conspiracies
        that quickly overwhelm the working memory. We become like Slothrop, that peripatetic paranoid, searching for hidden connections,
        signs of election, something to latch onto. It sure beats the alternative: "If there is something comforting - religous, if you 
        want - about paranoia, there is still also anti-paranoia, where nothing is connected to anything, a condition not many of us can 
        bear for long" (434).</p> <br>
        
        <h2 align = "center">The Math</h2>
        "If tensor analysis is good enough for turbulence, it ought to be good enough for history. There ought to be nodes, critical points ... 
        there ought to be super-derivatives of the crowded and insatiate flow that can be set equal to zero and those critical points found" (451). <br>

        <br>With these ideas in mind, I set out to turn modern mathematical methods of analysis on the novel itself and attempt to impose my own 
        order on its apparent chaos. Because Gravity's Rainbow is about not only individual characters and how they connect, 
        but the interactions between groups of characters that comprise organizations, I knew that a graph, which is limited only to 
        pairwise connections between nodes, would not suffice to capture all of the relevant information. Formally, what you are looking at is 
        a hypergraph, defined as H = (X,E) where X is the set of nodes (in this case characters, i.e X = {Tyrone Slothrop, Roger Mexico, Katje Borgesius,...}) 
        and E is a set of non-empty subsets of X, known as hyperedges, which encapsulate both standard graph edges such as {Vaslav Tchitcherine, Geli Tripping}, which
        are represented as an a line between nodes, but also groups of arbitrary size such as the Argentinian Anarchists: {Francisco Squalidozzi, Luz, Felipe, El Nato, 
        Belaustegui, Graciela Imago Portales}, which are represented by rectangles around nodes. Similar efforts had already been made for the <a href = "https://sciencekings.com/GravitysRainbowCharacters.pdf"> major characters/ideas</a> of Gravity's Rainbow,
        the characters of <a href = "https://inherent-vice.com/">Inherent Vice</a> and for other novels with many characters such as 
        <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com/github/pnnl/HyperNetX/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorial%203%20-%20LesMis%20Case%20Study.ipynb"> Les Mis</a>,
        but I wanted to make something that 1) included every character in one network, 2) adhered more closely to what I thought was the natural graph 
        structure of characters as nodes, edges as connections, groups as hyperedges and 3) could be open sourced into an interactive, wiki like project
        that others could benefit from and contribute to. <br>

        <h2 align = "center">Methodology</h2>
        "If you want the truth - I know I presume - you must look into the technology of these matters. Even into the hearts of
        certain molecules - it is they after all which dictate temperatures, pressures, rates of flow, costs, profits, the shapes
        of towers" (167). <br>

        <br>This network was first drawn by hand while reading (which I recommend avoiding doing in a public space past maybe 10 characters), 
        then input to the computer graphically using <a href="https://cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>,
        and displayed using <a href="https://js.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape.js</a> with html. Obtaining a useable layout with a minimal number of edge crossings
        was <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_number_(graph_theory)#Complexity_and_approximation">hard</a> but after messing around with 
        algorithmic formatting I settled on a hand drawn layout. There are still spots that are crowded/overlap in awkward ways, but the nodes can be clicked and dragged 
        to make for easier reading. Certain important groups such as The Counterforce and characters involved with Imipolex G were created, but eventually omitted because their 
        membership crosses multiple group boundaries, making it difficult to draw cleanly. I am working on other methods of visualizing these hyperedges.<br>
        
        <br>My criteria for including a character was that the character is 1) named and 2) performs some action in the context of the novel. This criteria excludes 
        individuals such as Richard Nixon, who is named but does not perform any action, as well as the dancers and chimpanzees of GMB Haftung, who perform 
        actions, but remain unnamed.  Using this criteria I ended up with 242 characters which is well below the 400 quoted in secondary sources, 
        which likely count historical figures as well as unnamed characters. <br>

        <br>All page numbers referenced here and in the graph are from the 1995 Penguin Twentieth Century Classics edition of Gravity's Rainbow (with
        the blue rocket diagram on the cover), which is coneveniently the same as <a href = "http://books.google.com/books?id=iPDGp7VT8H8C&printsec=frontcover"> this</a>
        searchable Google Books copy. Those with access to Weisenburger's companion could probably translate roughly between editions. <br>

        "Of course a well-developed They-system is necessary - but it's only half the story. For every They there ought to be a We. In our case there is.
        Creative paranoia means developing at least as thorough a We-system as a They-system ... We don't have to worry about questions of real or unreal
        ... It's the <i>system</i> that matters. How the data arrange themselves inside it. Some are consistent, others fall apart" (638). <br>

        <br>This project is <a href = "https://github.com/jcotter814/A-Gravity-s-Rainbow-Hypergraph"> open source</a> and in theory anyone with ideas for improvements 
        should feel free to submit a pull request. <br>

        <br><b>Planned improvements:</b>
        <br>- General style improvements.
        <br>- Using index of characters by order of appearance to allow for the generation of spoiler free networks up to the end of books 1, 2, 3 and 4.
        <br>- Upgrades to allow for direct, graphical editing of the network for users who are not familiar with coding/git. <br>
        
        <br><b>Ideas for possible contributions:</b>
        <br>- Enhanced edge information, including page number references.
        <br>- Clarification of the membership of the hyperedges SHAEF, SPOG, Operation Blackwing as well as the various subgroups of Hereros.
        <br>- Characters indexed by order of appearance to page level accuracy to allow for the generation of spoiler free networks up to exact pages.
        <br>- Enhanced node/character information available on clicking/hovering, perhaps integrated with the Gravity's Rainbow wiki.
        <br>- Searchable nodes/hyperedges <br>
